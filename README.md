# Facade-design

The goal of this program was to implement Facade design pattern. I used a character array for this program.
There are various functions ranging from initialization of the array, resizing, shrinking etc. that manipulate the
array without any memory leakage. The facade Design loosely decouples the declaration from the functionality which
allows the same header file to be able to be implemented differently for different clients.

## Optimized array functionality and prevented memory leaks using:

Constructors

Destructors

Inline functions

Operator Overloading

Dynamic array allocation
